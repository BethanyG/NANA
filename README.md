## NANA (Not Another Nutrition App)

**NANA** (**N**ot **A**nother **N**utrition **A**pp) enables users to get a quick nutritional analysis on a recipe as a starting point for more involved tracking of their intake.  Because the process starts with a URL (no typing in ingredients!), it lowers the activation energy for investigating and recording meal details.  It allows users to flag ingredients/volumes that might be in their "red zone" -- or note items that will take more investigation.  Users quickly start where they are, adjusting serving size or changing key components (like salt).  Why do it all by hand if **NANA** can help?

### Implemented Features:

- Recipe cleaning and parsing from three supported websites
- Nutritional Analysis per ingredient via USDA Nutrient DB
- Clean, clear display of recipe and nutritional totals via customized nutrition label

### Future Features:

- Ingredient Substitution and dynamic re-analysis
